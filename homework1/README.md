This folder contains my submission for Homework 1, due June 2, 2025, at 17:00, for MLESS.

## My Contributions

- Replaced the vanilla CNN with ResNetWith4Channels, adapting ResNet18 for 4-channel input and 6 output classes.
- Added evaluation code for Cohen's Kappa and multi-class ROC curves with AUC scores.
- Added a cat emoji ðŸ˜¸ at the start of each cell I created or modified to mark my contributions.
- Included Markdown cells to document the model structure, Kappa, and ROC evaluations.
